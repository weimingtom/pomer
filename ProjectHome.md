## Pomer Components ##
  * [Flex Framework](FlexFramework.md)
Pomer developed by spring and hibernate as a background framework, through blazeds (LCDS) RemoteObject Communication with the Java, the web layer uses of Cairngorm MVC framework, Pomer's role is to simplify access of blazeds (LCDS) RemoteObject and improve the efficiency of development. Through the Annotation, Pomer takes java of POJO object、Spring Bean and EJB Deployment as RemoteObject to provide access to flex without any configuration.

  * [Code Generation](CodeGeneration.md)
Pomer code generator has two parts, a powerful and flexible code generator, and a set of default template. Pomer code generator used Freemark as a template engine, which can generate code based on any table of database or JavaPojo and java interface, users just provide a freemark template. Pomer can generate CRUD code with table of database, AS DTO、Flex Form List and Flex DataGrid with javaBean, Cairmgorm framework code with Java Interface.

  * [Flex Component](FlexComponent.md) - Provides a series of high-performance components for user interaction, rendering an excellent user experience

  * [Organization Structure](OrganizationStructure.md)
The agile, lightweight, standalone, easy to implant organization management module.

  * [Security Management](SecurityManagement.md)
Simple role-based access control (RBAC) and access control menu.

  * [SAM SSO](SSO.md)
